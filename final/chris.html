			<br>
				<p><strong>This is Not America</strong> is a game where you try and memorize as many basic phrases as you can before you go to a non-english speaking place. Game starts with a phrase sheet that you have 5 minutes to memorize the most fundamental phrases and words you can before the game begins. Once the game begins you will pick cards that have situations or dialogue in a different language. The dialogue and situations you will be in are very basic and are meant to help guide you through daily activities you'd have or want to carry out when you are in a different country. The point of the game is to give you enough exposure to a foreign language so that if you do ever encounter it in a real life situation it does not seem so foreign and you have enough knowledge of phrases that you can get by.</p>

			<br>
				<ol class="RedNumbers">	
					<li>Each player begins the game at the airport, the start.</li>
					<li>At the start of each game, every player rolls the die once. Whoever rolls the highest number goes first and the rest fall in place in descending order.</li>
					<li>As each player rolls the dice and moves along the board, they will collect points based on correct or incorrect interaction based on the card.</li>
                    <li>Each correct interaction will award the player who answers with 1 point.</li>
                    <li>The first player to reach 15 points wins the game.</li>
                </ol>
