			<br>
			<p>The scary thing about the future... there will be tiny cameras everywhere, and they'll be flying around like mosquitoes and drones. That will be bad. Drones are scary. You can't reason with a drone. - Matt Groening</p>

            <h3 class="spacedout">Purpose of Governemnt Operated Drones</h3>
			<br>
			Technology is one industry that is always rapidly growing and changing. Drones are a relatively new technology, that have proven to cause issues with any individualâ€™s privacy.  As far as we are concerned drones serve two main purposes and they are to monitor or to attack. Attack Drones are useful for quick attacks where manned flight is considered too risky. While on the other hand Surveillance Drones are used for Intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance missions.

            <h3 class="spacedout">Target Audience</h3>
            <br>Seeing as Young Adults are the ones more likely to make use of technology I figured they would be the best to educate. Therefore the range for young adults is anywhere from teenage years to adulthood.
